# Data Structures and Algorithms

## What are Data Structures?
Data structures are a way to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They provide a means to manage large amounts of data for use in databases and internet indexing services. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.

## What are Algorithms?
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They are a set of rules or instructions that provide a method for processing data. Algorithms can be used for a variety of tasks, such as sorting data, searching for data, and performing calculations.
